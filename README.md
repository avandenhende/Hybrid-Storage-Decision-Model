# Introduction
The Hybrid Storage Decision Model (HSDM) is designed to assist engineers, planners, and other stakeholders in designing renewable energy grids that combine solar power, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and hydrogen storage systems (HSS). It determines the lowest-cost mix of these technologies to meet user-defined hourly energy demand profiles. The model formulates this as a linear programming optimization problem. Users provide inputs such as system location, hourly demand data, and cost/performance parameters for each technology. The model outputs optimal installed capacities, dispatch profiles, and cost metrics such as levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
